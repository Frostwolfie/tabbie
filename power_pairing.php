Thoughts on Power Pairing Theory.

This is an attempt ('article') to formulate some thoughts surrounding Debating Tournament Tab Systems, i.e. the allocation of teams to debates, and the appreciation of their achievements in terms of moving up and down the final ranking. Throughout my debating carreer I've been surprised by the lack of structured thought and debate surrounding these issues and the great amount of mystical statements and figures - this is an attempt to change this. It is also an attempt to open debate on the different forms and to discover if some are strictly better than others (under clearly defined goals and assumptions). It is very much work in progress.

The main ideas in this article should be understandable with some effort by anyone who has the intellectual level to participate in debating. With Power Pairing running most tournaments, it should also be an issue of concern to exactly those people, and specifically to anyone involved in organizing tournaments. I am not much of a statistical wizard myself, so don't expect a very formal approach; a more formal response would be much appreciated.


Firstly, I will state a clear goal for any Tournament System, and clarify some definitions. 

I will explore some forms of Power Pairing I've heard about, and make (somewhat funded) statements about their relative efficacy at attaining this goal. I will also compare this with forms of allocation of teams to debates that are not used much

I will present a number of things I've found by 

Definitions:
Break
Folded Break
Bracket


Goals:
Firstly, and formostly, a good Power Pairing system will ensure that the teams that performed the best in the tournament will make it to the brake in the right order. (The importance of the right teams making it to the break as compared to those teams breaking in the right order will be discussed seperately).

Secondly, the tournament will be more fun....


Having the best team win and everyone having a good time depends on many things: the quality and balance of the motions, the quality of the adjudications panels, the allocation of judges to different debates and the amount of free alcohol served to name a few. However, I will make a case here that Power Pairing is important enough to be discussed openly and scientiffically, and not, as is happening too often now, in secrecy and in almost mystical terms. Also, the allocation of judges to debates will be discussed seperately.


Issues:
Relevance of speaking positions' winning chances.
