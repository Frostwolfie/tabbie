  <h1 id="main">Tabbie - British Parliamentary Debating Tabbing Software</h1>

  <div id="content">

<h1>Tabbie</h1>
<p>Tabbie is software that makes it easy to do "Powerpairing" or "Tabbing" of British 
Parliamentary Debating Tournaments. Tabbie was first succesfully used in the NTU worlds 
2004. Tabbie is in active development and support as of June, 2007</p>

<h3>Online Demo</h3>
<p>We provide <a href="run/">A small demo of the workings of Tabbie (0.2.1) here</a>. It 
should be understood that due to the nature of a demo, not everything will work (especially 
things involving writing to files). Also, realise that you are not neceserraly the only 
person playing with it at any given time. Feel free to play around though!.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Downloading can be done at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199347">Sourceforge</a>. Please 
realise that you will also need a webserver (php) and mysql to get this working. You may 
be interested in <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">an easy package that combines mysql and 
apache</a>.</p>

<h3>Participate, Support</h3>
<p>We would welcome any participation in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tabbie/">Tabbie Project</a>. This is also the 
source for any support questions you may have. Many tab systems seem to exist
side by side without any significant cooperation. Also, many systems die out when their 
original developer leaves the debating scene. Tabbie is an attempt to reverse that trend, by 
taking proven software and making it available to everyone.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The following message was found on <a href="http://flynn.debating.net/">Colm Flynn's 
site</a> and 
forms the basis for this project. Most of it is out of date by now - specifically, the 
current maintainers have not yet reached the original developers. If you want a 
working version of Tabbie, read the above. Colm's message begins here:</p>

<p>The organising committee of Singapore Worlds 2004 developed an excellent
system to run their tab.&nbsp; Deepak Jois and	Aditya Krishnan were the
developers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hosted on their website <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/worlds" target="_blank">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/worlds</a>
but I have copied it here in case it disappears and that would be a big loss.</p>

<p>Here is a note they had on the website.</p>

<p>Tabbie v0.1 (NTU Worlds 2004 tab software)<br>
<br>
Both of us are busy with our final year, and hence we cannot find time to clean up the 
software and package it nicely and to write some help. We will get to that after we graduate 
in May. Till then, you can try following the instructions below. Please note that for 
operating this software in the current state, you need to have basic knowledge of 
Apache/PHP/MySQL. You may start by following the instructions at the websites of the various 
software.<br>
<br>
1. Go to http://www.phphome.net and install the latest version. You will have PHP, Apache, 
MySQL and phpMyAdmin installed on your computer, all in one package.<br>
<br>
2. After configuring them appropriately (You will find the instructions on the respective 
sites), please use phpMyAdmin and run the queries in the file worlds_database_Setup.sql<br>
<br>
3. After that, you may start the tab software by running the file worlds/index.php from your 
web browser.<br>
<br>
4. There is a very basic user guide in the docs folder.<br>

<br>
5. Any problems, we will be glad to help. Please include the full nature of the problem, and 
please make an effort on your part before contacting us (see 
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html for some tips)<br>
